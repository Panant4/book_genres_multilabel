# book_genres_multilabel
Classifying book genres based on their summaries using a multilabel network

Data: Book data from the UCI repository

Attributes: Genre,Summary,Labels(One record can have multiple labels)

Several methods were implemented to assess the ability to distinguish books and predict the correct genres. We implemented various multi-label feature extraction and classification techniques. The results showed that the multi-label models implemented performed relatively better as compared to the neural network and the recurrent neural network models.Also, the precision, recall and f1 scores of the best model are quite comparable with the human book genre classification showing that the task in itself is hard because of the overlapping sense of the genres.
